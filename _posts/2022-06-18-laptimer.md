From sixth to twelfth grade, I was a competitive swimmer. Starting at 4:30 AM, I'd wake up to drive to the pool to spend the next two hours at swim practice before going to school and then returning to the pool for another two hour practice in the afternoon. It was hard work, but I grew to love it.

The years I spend swimming remind me of a saying: "camaraderie found through shared hardships."
