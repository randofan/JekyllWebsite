I've been a competitive swimmer for most of my life now. For three years straight, I'd start my days off at 5:00 AM with a two hour swim practice before then going to school. It was hard, and I nearly burned out at least a half a dozen times, but, in the end, I think it was worth it.

Now that I've stopped swimming in college, I like to look back at those times and remind myself of the lessons I learned from it. Swimming always reminded me of a phrase: "camaraderie found through shared hardships." I think this is something all people learn overtime. Whether its struggling your way through swim practice or living in the worst dorm on campus, we all share some adversity, which in the end makes us stronger.

This love and debt I owe to the sport of swimming motivated me to work on **Split Lap Timer**. After watching my coaches struggle with tracking the times of all their athletes on one or two stopwatches, I thought Split Lap Timer would be the perfect remedy. With 8 stopwatches, it allows coaches to individually track the splits of 8 swimmers at once, eliminating the hassle of manually calculating individual lap times.
