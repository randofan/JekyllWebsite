Split Lap Timer is basically done now...Except for one thing: Apple & Xcode. Unfortunately I don't own an iMac. Thus, I can't download Xcode, and therefore cannot complete my final step for deploying my app to the Apple App Store. It's frustrating to say the least. Now, my only hope is to wait till I move into my new apartment for the upcoming school year where they have some iMacs. Until then, the arduous wait begins.
